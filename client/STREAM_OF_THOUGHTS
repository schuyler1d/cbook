♔,말  K$J%#$%J#:Lあ叶葉K$J%#$%J#:L
support unicode for most languages by doing a min() on the unicode chars, and
subtracting the value off from all the chars.  Then put the min() in the front

14chars for IV
1char for addition
4chars for ♔.☿ (could make it 3)
'http://skyb.us/' == 15 chars
140=17+1+4+15+103

ascii 61-* is ok.  avoid [^<&;]

128+12=140

128*128=16384

2299099 is last unicode char I see
but there are lots of holes

Who do you trust?

DEEPER levels of paranoia:
--------------------------
your hosting company
  you put your SSL private key on the host, so they can pretend to be you
  
  What to do:

your web browser
  certificates

your email communication channel
  Google admits they read your email.  How many other companies do the same?
 
  What to do:  use pgp encryption

your operating system
  
  What to do: well, first how about trying Linux--at least,
    other people can analyze the source code that it was based on
    and Linux-people are hippies anyway, right?

  Actually, it's a good first step


your compiler
  


your computer
  Who knows what secret instructions Intel and AMD were told to add
   by the NSA or China.  Wait!  A lot of these chip and computer
   factories are IN China....

  What to do?
    Well, there's open-source hardware.  You could get some eproms and 
    punch in the assembly by hand to the.....AHHAHHAH!
